Transactional SLIM/FIT runner for FitNesse/Java 

This is an implementation of the Slim test runner for Fitnesse that wraps all tests into spring transactions and rolls back on the end of each test, to make data-driven tests instantly repeatable with minimal code and no configuration changes in the fixtures or the Spring context.
